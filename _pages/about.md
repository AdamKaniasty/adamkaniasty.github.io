I am Adam Kaniasty, a co-founder and CTO of APPI, where I lead AI and ML projects that push the boundaries of what technology can do for industries like construction and architecture. My current focus is on developing intelligent systems that improve information retrieval using RAG techniques. Recently, I've also worked on a Kubernetes pod autoscaling project using RL models.

I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Data Science at the Warsaw University of Technology. Throughout my academic and professional career, I have contributed to several key projects, including the development of terrain segmentation models for space probes, sentiment analysis tools, and even reinforcement learning models designed to conquer video game levels.

Beyond tech, I’m passionate about sports—training tennis and martial arts keeps me sharp. I also enjoy sharing my knowledge, mentoring AI enthusiasts, and speaking at events like No Code Days and university AI clubs.
